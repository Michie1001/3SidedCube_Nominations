## Challenges

1. Sickness - I fell ill on Saturday and was unable to properly put in my best. I did not request for an extension because I still feel ill and don't think having just a day more would make a significant difference to my submission. 
2. API integration using TanStack - had to use Postman to check the server status, once I found that it was good, I got the list of nominees, but I was unable to display the list on the project using react-query or axios.


### Extra Technologies
1. Postman - to visualize the working of the API. 

## Extra features
1. Animated background on desktop.
2. Removed the '+' on the mobile header as I saw no real purpose of it being there if the 'Create Nomination' button was present.
3. A confetti library for the success page.
4. 404 page.

## With more time, I could ...
1. Complete the API integration (I believe I've almost got it).
2. Complete the table implementation.
3. Properly debug and complete the Yup validation for the forms using the API values.
4. Complete the progress slider.
5. Create the slider on the process screen using radio buttons.
6. States for the buttons.
7. Include more micro interactions like making the icons bounce on hover.
